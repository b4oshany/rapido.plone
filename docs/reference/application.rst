Application
===========

A Rapido application is defined by a folder in the ``rapido`` folder in the
current theme.

The application folder might contain a ``settings.yaml`` file in its root to
define its access control settings (see below), but that is not mandatory.

It always contain a ``blocks`` folder containing its blocks (see below).

It might also contain regular theme items (rules.xml, CSS, Javascript, etc.).
