Associated Python functions
===========================

For a ``BASIC`` element, the associated Python function (having the same id)
will return the content of the element.

For field elements (``TEXT``, ``NUMBER``, ``DATETIME``), the associated Python
function will return its default value.

For an ``ACTION`` element, the associated Python function will be executed when
the action is triggered.
