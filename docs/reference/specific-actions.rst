Specific actions
================

The following actions can included in our block HTML layout, and they will not
require an associated Python function:

- ``_save``: will create a record based on the field elements submitted values
  and then redirect to the record display in read mode;
- ``_edit``: will open the current record in edit mode;
- ``_delete``: will delete the current record.
