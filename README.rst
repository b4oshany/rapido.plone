What for?
=========

Creating a small form able to send an email, or to store some data, generating
an extra information about a page and insert it wherever we want; with Plone
that kind of tasks are complex for experts, and almost impossible for beginners.

**rapido.plone** allows any developer having a little knowledge of HTML and a
little knowledge of Python to implement custom elements and insert them anywhere
they want in their Plone site.

How?
====

The unique interface to build applications with rapido.plone is the **Plone
theming tool**.

It implies it can be achieved in the **file system** or through the theming
**inline editor**.

A Rapido application is just a piece of our current theme, it can be
imported, exported, copied, modified, etc. like the rest of the theme.

Moreover, we can use `Diazo <http://docs.diazo.org/en/latest/>`_ extensively to
inject our application in the Plone layout easily.
